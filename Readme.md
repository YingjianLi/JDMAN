# JDMAN
Pytorch code release for ["JDMAN: Joint Discriminative and Mutual Adaptation Networks for Cross-Domain Facial Expression Recognition"](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3474085.3475484) (ACM MM'21) and ["Deep Margin-Sensitive Representation Learning for Cross-Domain Facial Expression Recognition"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9676449)(IEEE TMM'22)

## Requirements
Python3.6+, Pytorch 1.2.0+

## Training

For example, training using VGG backbone:

```
sh ./raf_sh/raf2ck/raf2ck_vgg16_center_MI.sh
```

We recommend VGG backbone for more stale performance.
